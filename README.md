Analysis of USA wildfire data. The goal of this analysis was to explore and investigate how wildfires have changed over the time period included in the dataset. For example, I looked at wildfire distributions across states, seasons, and causes. The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires.
